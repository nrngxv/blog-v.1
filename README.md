# A simple web application to display blogs
This project was made to advance my understanding of how Django works. This is an application that lets person upload articles as blog post to a webiste.
- The simple frontend is built with [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- The theme is from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). 
- The Django forms made better using [django crispy forms](https://pypi.org/project/django-crispy-forms/). 
- Text editor for blog posting made using [tinyMCE](https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## How this works
First check if you are on the latest version of python or not. Run this in your terminal
```
python --version
```
It should say Python 3.11.4

Next, Clone this GitHub respository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nrngxv/polls.git
```

Next, cd into the directory where the git is cloned, and run this command
```
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the server.

Next, go to this web address ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` and you will see the home page for the application

## Explanation of the interface
This is the home page.
- Navigation bar
