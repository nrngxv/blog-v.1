# A simple web application to display blogs
It has some basic funtionalities like adding blog posts, deleting them, liking them and have a section that can display featured articles.
Aim of this program was to improve my understanding of django and work with frontend stuff a little more.

[Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) helped building the simple frontend and theme is from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

Django forms made better using [django crispy forms](https://pypi.org/project/django-crispy-forms/).

Text editor for blog posting made using [tinyMCE](https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
